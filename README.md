## About

This project aims to classify emotions in human faces using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains images labeled with one of seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The implemented model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.
